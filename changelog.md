fixed a fatal flaw.
(because there is no specialization of nested packaging classes 
(not the structure used to wrap the type, it is the class used 
by this structure to wrap the type (currently std::tuple)), 
the nested type cannot be converted correctly), because of the 
lack of testing, this error has only been discovered so far.
There are still some obvious errors and more testing is needed.
